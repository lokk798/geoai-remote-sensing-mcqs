## True/False Questions

**1. Feature-level fusion involves combining raw sensor inputs before any processing.**

- **False**  
  (Feature-level fusion occurs after feature extraction, not raw input fusion.)

---

**2. Deep learning models like CNNs can perform fusion at multiple levels, including feature and decision levels.**

- **True**

---

**3. Social media geotags have no role in real-time disaster response fusion.**

- **False**  
  (They are used to validate real-time data such as flood zones.)

---

**4. SAR imagery can be affected by cloud cover just like optical imagery.**

- **False**  
  (SAR can penetrate clouds, unlike optical sensors.)

---

**5. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) do not consider spatial relationships in the fusion process.**

- **False**  
  (GNNs explicitly use spatial structure by modeling locations and connections.)
