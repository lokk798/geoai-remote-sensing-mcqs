- Avoids the need for training data

**4. Which feature extraction technique is best known for being scale-invariant?**

- Gabor
- SURF
- SIFT ✅
- LBP

**5. What distinguishes global feature vectors from local feature vectors?**

- They require more storage space.

**9. In feature learning, abstraction means:**

- Extracting features only at the pixel level
- Capturing high-level concepts from raw data ✅
- Ignoring all low-level patterns
- Manual design of filters

**10. Why might LASSO be preferred in feature selection?**

- It increases model complexity
- It promotes sparsity and interpretability ✅
- It uses deep learning automatically
- It selects all features for analysis
